# Sprint Backlog (List of acheivables)

~~1. Create home/title page~~
~~2. Implement privacy handling and strict content policy~~
~~3. Create SQLite database for accounts~~
~~4. Design frontend framework with HTML~~
~~5. New user sign up functionality~~

## Increment (What must be completed by the end of the sprint)

- Landing page consisting of sign in and sign-up buttons
- Login information to be stored in an SQLite database
- Privacy handling and content policy that is easily accesible for users

## Sprint Review (Focus on project management)

### What challenges did you have

- Determining correct endroutes to interfaces. I found it challenging keep the endroutes to each template the same as i kept changing them throughout frontend and backend code
- Using CSRF tokens correctly. Implementing CSRF tokens to each page when rendered was a challenge as I was finding it difficult to determine how and where to place them.
- Getting sidetracked and not following an agile approach and my sprint backlog. This led to me spending unnessecary time on things that I should be completing later down the line.

### What did you do well

- Debbuging any errors that occured during runtime. I used the security log and debugging tools to my advantage to efficiently solve any problems that I was experiencing during runtime.

### What will you do differently next time

- Follow a more strict Agile Approach and the sprint backlog that I have set for myself
